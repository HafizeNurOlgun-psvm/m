                    <p style=margin-bottom:50px></p>
                    <i>The Scratch Privacy Policy was last updated: February 14, 2019

                    Scratch understands how important privacy is to our community, especially kids and parents. We wrote
                    this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through our website (scratch.mit.edu)
                    (the "Site"), how we use, process, and share it, and what we're doing to keep it safe. It also tells
                    you about your rights and choices with respect to your information, and how you can contact us if
                    you have any questions or concerns. <p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    <div class="view-box">If you would like to build projects with Scratch without submitting any
                        Personal Information to us, you can download the Scratch Offline Editor. Projects created in the
                        Scratch Offline Editor are not accessible by the Scratch Team, and using the offline editor does
                        not disclose any personally identifying information to Scratch unless you upload these projects
                        to the Scratch online community.</div>
                    <p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>



                    <b>What personal information does the Scratch Team collect about me?</b>
                    For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an
                    identified or identifiable individual. We obtain Personal Information relating to you from various
                    sources described below.

                    Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as
                    well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Information when
                    requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Site if that information is necessary to provide
                    you with the service or if we are legally required to collect the information.<p
                        style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    Account Information<p style=margin-bottom:60px></p>

                    In order to share projects, create studios, or post comments, you need to make an account. During
                    account creation, we ask you for a username, your country, birth month and year, gender, and your
                    email address (or your parent or guardian's email address if you are under 16 years old). We ask
                    that you select a username that does not disclose your real name or other information that could
                    identify you. Other users can see your username and country, but not your age, gender, or email
                    address.<p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    2.3 You may not use another person's Scratch account without permission.<p style=margin-bottom:30px>
                    </p>

                    User-generated Content<p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    We collect any information that you provide to us when you create Scratch projects (including unshared projects), write comments, or post on our forums.

                    Internal and Service-Related Usage

                    1.2 Your privacy is important to us. Please read our Privacy Policy, which identifies how the
                    Scratch Team uses, collects, and stores information it collects through the Services. By using
                    Scratch, you additionally agree that you are comfortable with Scratch's Privacy Policy. <p

                    using the Scratch services. When you use Scratch, you agree to abide by the Scratch Community
                    Guidelines. <p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    1.4 The Scratch Team may change the Terms of Use from time to time. You can always find the latest
                    version of the Terms of Use at http://scratch.mit.edu/terms_of_use. The date of the most recent
                    revisions will appear on this page. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance
                    of any changes to or revisions of the Terms of Use. <p style=margin-bottom:60px></p>

                    2.1 In order to use some features of the Services, you will need to register with Scratch and create
                    an account. Creating an account is optional, but without an account you will not be able to save or
                    publish projects or comments on Scratch. When registering for a personal account, you will be asked
                    to provide certain personal information, such as your email address, gender, birth month and year,
                    and country. Please see Scratch's Privacy Policy for Scratch's data retention and usage policies.<p
                        style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    2.2 You are responsible for keeping your password secret and your account secure. You are solely
                    responsible for any use of your account, even if your account is used by another person. If any use
                    of your account violates the Terms of Service, your account may be suspended or deleted.<p
                        style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    2.3 You may not use another person's Scratch account without permission.<p style=margin-bottom:30px>
                    </p>

                    2.4 Account names cannot be changed. If you want a different account name, create a new account and
                    copy your existing projects over by hand.<p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    2.5 If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (for example, in the event
                    of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password), promptly change your password. If
                    you cannot access your account to change your password, notify us at help@scratch.mit.edu. <p

                    use of scratch.mit.edu and all associated services, including but not limited to the Scratch Day and
                    ScratchX websites (collectively "Scratch"). The Scratch Team is part of the Lifelong Kindergarten
                    Group in the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ("MIT"). Please read the
                    Terms of Use carefully. By using Scratch you affirm that you have read, understood, and accepted the
                    terms and conditions in the Terms of Use. If you do not agree with any of these conditions, please
                    do not use Scratch. <p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>
