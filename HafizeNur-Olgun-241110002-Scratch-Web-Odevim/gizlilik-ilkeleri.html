                    1.1 These Terms of Use constitute an agreement between you and the Scratch Team that governs your
                    use of scratch.mit.edu and all associated services, including but not limited to the Scratch Day and
                    ScratchX websites (collectively "Scratch"). The Scratch Team is part of the Lifelong Kindergarten
                    Group in the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ("MIT"). Please read the
                    Terms of Use carefully. By using Scratch you affirm that you have read, understood, and accepted the
                    terms and conditions in the Terms of Use. If you do not agree with any of these conditions, please
                    do not use Scratch. <p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    1.2 Your privacy is important to us. Please read our Privacy Policy, which identifies how the
                    Scratch Team uses, collects, and stores information it collects through the Services. By using
                    Scratch, you additionally agree that you are comfortable with Scratch's Privacy Policy. <p
                        style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    1.3 Scratch is open to children and adults of all ages, and we ask that you keep this in mind when
                    using the Scratch services. When you use Scratch, you agree to abide by the Scratch Community
                    Guidelines. <p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    version of the Terms of Use at http://scratch.mit.edu/terms_of_use. The date of the most recent
                    revisions will appear on this page. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance

                    an account. Creating an account is optional, but without an account you will not be able to save or
                    publish projects or comments on Scratch. When registering for a personal account, you will be asked
                    to provide certain personal information, such as your email address, gender, birth month and year,
                    and country. Please see Scratch's Privacy Policy for Scratch's data retention and usage policies.<p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    2.2 You are responsible for keeping your password secret and your account secure. You are solely
                    responsible for any use of your account, even if your account is used by another person. If any use
                    of your account violates the Terms of Service, your account may be suspended or deleted.<p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    2.3 You may not use another person's Scratch account without permission.<p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    2.4 Account names cannot be changed. If you want a different account name, create a new account and
                    copy your existing projects over by hand.<p style=margin-bottom:30px></p>

                    2.5 If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (for example, in the event
                    of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password), promptly change your password. If
